# AutoMCP Framework

## Overview

AutoMCP is a lightweight implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), designed to facilitate the creation and deployment of service-oriented architectures with a focus on AI model integration. The framework stands out for its configuration-driven approach and seamless Claude integration capabilities.

## Core Features

1. Service Architecture
   - Group-based service organization
   - Configuration-driven deployment
   - Support for both single and multi-group services
   - Concurrent request processing

2. Integration Capabilities
   - Native Claude AI integration
   - Robust input validation via Pydantic
   - Extensible operation system
   - Strong type safety throughout

## Technical Implementation

### Service Groups
The framework implements a hierarchical structure:
```python
class ServiceGroup:
    # Base class for all service groups
    # Manages lifecycle and operation execution
```

### Operation Definition
Operations are defined using decorators and Pydantic models:
```python
@operation(schema=InputModel)
async def process(self, input: InputModel) -> ExecutionResponse:
    # Operation implementation
    pass
```

## Integration with LionAGI

AutoMCP's architecture aligns with [[LionAGI Framework Overview]] in several ways:
- Both emphasize type safety and validation
- Share similar service-oriented architectural patterns
- Focus on clean separation of concerns

This makes it a potential candidate for:
- Service deployment within LionAGI projects
- Model serving infrastructure
- Request validation and processing

## Development Guidelines

1. Service Creation
   - Define clear service boundaries
   - Use Pydantic models for input validation
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Document operations thoroughly

2. Configuration Management
   ```yaml
   name: service-name
   description: Service purpose
   groups:
     module.path:GroupClass:
       name: group-name
       config:
         setting: value
   ```

3. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for operations
   - Integration tests for service groups
   - Configuration validation tests
   - Load testing for concurrent processing
