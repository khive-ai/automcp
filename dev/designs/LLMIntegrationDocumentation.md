# LLM Integration Documentation Design

## Overview

This document provides a detailed design for the LLM integration documentation for the AutoMCP framework. The LLM integration documentation was identified as particularly sparse in the testing report, and this design aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for developing complete and useful documentation in this area.

## 1. Documentation Structure

The LLM integration documentation will consist of three main files:

1. `llm_integration/concepts.md`: Core concepts for integrating AutoMCP with LLMs
2. `llm_integration/tool_design.md`: Best practices for designing effective tools for LLMs
3. `llm_integration/prompt_engineering.md`: Techniques for effective prompting with AutoMCP servers

Each file will follow this structure:
- Level 1 heading for the title
- Brief introduction
- Level 2 headings for major sections
- Level 3 headings for subsections
- Code examples
- Diagrams where appropriate
- "Related Resources" section with cross-references

```

#### Key Content Elements

1. **Tool Naming Examples**:
   ```python
   # Good tool names
   @operation(name="search_documents")
   async def search_documents(self, query: str) -> list[Document]:
       """Searches documents based on a query string."""
       
   # Less effective names
   @operation(name="sd")  # Too abbreviated
   async def search_docs(self, q: str) -> list[Document]:
       """Searches docs."""
   ```

2. **Schema Design Pattern**:
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
   
   class ImageGenerationParams(BaseModel):
       """Parameters for generating an image."""
       prompt: str = Field(
           ..., 
           description="Detailed description of the image to generate",
           examples=["A sunset over mountains with purple and orange sky"]
       )
       style: str = Field(
           "photorealistic", 
           description="The artistic style for the image",
           examples=["photorealistic", "cartoon", "oil painting", "3D render"]
       )
       width: int = Field(
           512, 
           description="Image width in pixels",
           ge=128, 
           le=1024
       )
       height: int = Field(
           512, 
           description="Image height in pixels",
           ge=128, 
           le=1024
       )
   ```

3. **Tool Family Example**:
   ```python
   # Basic tool
   @operation(name="summarize_text")
   async def summarize_text(self, text: str, length: int = 100) -> str:
       """Summarize text to specified length."""
       
   # Advanced tool in same family
   @operation(name="summarize_text_advanced")
   async def summarize_text_advanced(
       self, 
       text: str, 
       length: int = 100,
       focus_on: Optional[str] = None,
       style: str = "concise",
       format: str = "paragraph"
   ) -> str:
       """Advanced text summarization with more control."""
   ```

4. **Error Handling Pattern**:
   ```python
   @operation(name="fetch_data")
   async def fetch_data(self, source_id: str) -> dict:
       """Fetch data from a specific source."""
       try:
           # Fetch data logic...
       except SourceNotFoundError:
           return {
               "error": "source_not_found",
               "message": f"The source '{source_id}' could not be found.",
               "suggestion": "Try using list_sources to see available sources."
           }
       except RateLimitError:
           return {
               "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
               "message": "Rate limit exceeded for data fetching.",
               "suggestion": "Please try again in 60 seconds."
           }
   ```

#### Key Content Elements

1. **System Prompt Example**:
   ```
   You are an assistant with access to the following AutoMCP tools:

   1. search_documents: Search for documents based on a query string
      - Parameters:
        - query (string): The search query
        - max_results (integer, default=10): Maximum number of results to return
      
   2. summarize_text: Generate a summary of provided text
      - Parameters:
        - text (string): The text to summarize
        - max_length (integer, default=100): Maximum length of summary in words

   When a user asks a question, first search for relevant documents,
   then summarize the information if needed. Always cite your sources.
   ```

2. **Few-Shot Example**:
   ```
   User: "What's the capital of France?"
   
   Assistant: I'll help you find that information.
   
   I'll use the search_documents tool to find information about France's capital.
   
   search_documents(query="capital of France", max_results=3)
   
   Based on the search results, I can tell you that Paris is the capital of France.
   ```

3. **Error Recovery Example**:
   ```
   User: "Show me NASA's budget for 2050"
   
   Assistant: I'll look that up for you.
   
   search_documents(query="NASA budget 2050", max_results=5)
   
   I received an error: "No documents found matching the query."
   
   Let me try a more general search.
   
   search_documents(query="NASA future budget projections", max_results=5)
   
   Based on the search results, I can tell you that NASA's budget projections only 
   go up to 2030 in publicly available documents. The most recent projection for 
   2030 is approximately $25 billion, but this is subject to change based on 
   congressional approvals.
   ```

4. **Tool Sequencing Diagram**:
   - Visual representation of a multi-step process using different tools
   - Include prompt fragments showing how to guide the LLM through the sequence

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these documentation files:

1. **Code Examples**:
   - All examples should be complete and runnable
   - Use realistic scenarios that demonstrate practical usage
   - Include both simple and advanced examples

2. **Diagrams**:
   - Create diagrams for complex concepts
   - Use consistent visual style across all diagrams
   - Include captions explaining each diagram

3. **Cross-References**:
   - Add links to related documentation
   - Ensure all links are valid
   - Use consistent link formatting

4. **Formatting**:
   - Use consistent heading levels (no jumps)
   - Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
   - Use tables for comparing different approaches

5. **Tone and Style**:
   - Maintain a professional but accessible tone
   - Define technical terms when first used
   - Use active voice for clarity

## 4. Testing Criteria

The documentation should be tested against these criteria:

1. **Completeness**:
   - All planned sections are implemented
   - No placeholder content remains

2. **Accuracy**:
   - Code examples are syntactically correct
   - Technical information is accurate and up-to-date

3. **Clarity**:
   - Concepts are explained clearly
   - Examples illustrate points effectively

4. **Structure**:
   - Heading levels follow progressive disclosure
   - Content flow is logical

5. **Cross-References**:
   - All internal links work correctly
   - References to other documentation are valid

## 5. Conclusion

This detailed design provides a blueprint for implementing comprehensive LLM integration documentation for the AutoMCP framework. By following this design, the documentation will address the current sparse content issue and provide users with valuable guidance for integrating AutoMCP with Large Language Models.
